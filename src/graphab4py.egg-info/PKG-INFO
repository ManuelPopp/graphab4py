=====
This package provides a Python interface to the program `Graphab <https://sourcesup.renater.fr/www/graphab/en/home.html/>`_. The author(s) of this Python package are not developing Graphab. Rather, Graphab is an independent software which provides a graphical user interface, as well as a command line interface. Further information on Graphab can be found `here <https://sourcesup.renater.fr/www/graphab/en/home.html>`_.
